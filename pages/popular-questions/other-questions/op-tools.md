## HOW TO CREATE OP TOOLS

### WITH ESSENTIALS

1. Go to your **File Manager**, then `plugins -> Essentials -> config.yml`.
2. Look for `"unsafe-enchantments` and change the `"false"` to `"true"`.
3. Save the file and then either run `/ess reload` ingame or restart your server from the dashboard.

### WITHOUT ESSENTIALS

1. Hold the item you want to enchant.
2. Then uou can simply use the command `/enchant (enchantment) (level)`. For example, `/enchant sharpness 50`.
