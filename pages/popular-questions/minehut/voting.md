# Voting

## OVERVIEW

Voting is one of the only, if not the only, ways to get free credits.

## HOW VOTING WORKS \[FREE PREMIUM SERVER\]

If you vote every single day for 30 days, you'll end up with 750 credits _\(25 \[credit reward\]_ 30 \[days\] = 750\)_. The **MH20** plan only costs 720 credits per month. This means as long as you don't miss a vote and vote every single day, you can get a \*FREE_ MH20 server plan, with 30 credits to spare each month.
