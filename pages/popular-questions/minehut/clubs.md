# Forums Club

## OVERVIEW

Forum Clubs are like mini-forums for your Minehut server. You can create your own categories, create your own groups, pin announcements, and much more.

## HOW TO CREATE A FORUMS CLUB

At the top of the forums, click the `clubs page` and it will take you to a list of clubs. Then click the **“Start a Club”** button on the left side of the screen. Now fill in all the information about the club it gives you then click **save**. Your club is now created but it needs to be approved by a moderator before people can actually join it.
