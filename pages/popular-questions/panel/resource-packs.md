# Resource Packs

## ONLINE UPLOADING

Upload your resource pack to any online file uploader, eg Mediafire or Dropbox _\[Note: This must be non-expiable\]_. From there, copy the direct download link _\[if you've used Dropbox, change the `=0` at the end of the url to `=1`_\]

## PANEL UPLOADING

Head over to the **Settings** tab on your web panel. Scroll to the bottom and paste the link _\[see above\]_ under the **Resource Pack** heading. Now click **Save**, and restart your server.

## TO NOTE

To use resource packs, go to your Minecraft Multiplayer Server list. For the server `minehut.com`, click **Edit Server**. From here you can set the resource pack option to **enabled**, **disabled**, or **prompt**.

-   **Enabled** - The resource pack will automatically download and apply it, given that it's been uploaded correctly to the server.
-   **Disabled** - The resource pack won't download at all. You'll need to send them the link to download it and install it manually _\[not recommended\]_.
-   **Prompt** - The player will be prompted to download the resource pack.
