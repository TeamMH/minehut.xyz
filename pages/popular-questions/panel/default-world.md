# Default World

## OVERVIEW

Before you can set a default world, you must have uploaded the world you want to be the default one uploaded to your server. _\[Visit_ [_this tutorial_](https://minehut.xyz/faq/ul) _for more information on uploading worlds\]_.

In order to set a default world, you must first head over to the [Minehut Website](https://minehut.com) and start up your server. Once your server has started, you can click the `settings tab` and go to `level name` and type in the new default world name.

Now, any new users that join your server will spawn in the world that you have set.
