# Permissions

## PERMISSION MANAGERS

On Minehut, you have a choice of five permission managers:`Permissionsex, Luckperms, Groupmanager, Ultimateperms, zPermissions.` I recommend choosing between lp and pex as those are the most used/stable. Also, please note that the `/perms` command is NOT your current perms.

<Hint style="warning">
You only need to install 1 out of 5 permission managers, installing others may cause issues.
</Hint>

## HOW TO USE EACH PERMISSION MANAGER

<Hint style="info">
Each permission manager has lots more commands than shown below, visit each permission manager's tutorial page.
</Hint>

-   [**LuckPerms**](/plugins/permission-plugins/luckperms): `/lp user/group <player-name/group> permission set <perm node> true`

-   [**PermissionsEx**](/plugins/permission-plugins/permissionsex): `/pex [user/group] <player-name/group> add <perm node>`

-   [Group Manager](/plugins/permission-plugins/groupmanager): `/[manuaddp/mangaddp] <player-name/group> <perm node>`

-   [zPermissions](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/zpermissions.11736/): `/permissions [user/group] <player-name/group> set <perm node> true`
