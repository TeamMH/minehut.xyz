# Moderation

## Banning Users

You can ban users on Minehut using `/ban <name> [reason]`, as well as temporarily ban them with `/tempban <user> <duration {usually like 1m,1h,1d}> [reason]`. To unban a user is a bit different though, if your using essentials or a ban management plugin like LiteBans, use `/unban <player>`. For vanilla minecraft, use `/pardon <player>` to unban someone.

## Muting Users

To mute a user, you need to first install essentials and/or a moderation plugin. Then do `/mute <player> [reason]` or `/mute <player> <duration> [reason]`. You can also do this in vannilla minecraft, but its not to great, check it out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/3iueui/mute_players_in_vanilla/).

## Kicking Users

To kick a user, use `/kick <player> [reason]` to kick them.

Note that arguments between `< >` are required and `[ ]` are optional.
