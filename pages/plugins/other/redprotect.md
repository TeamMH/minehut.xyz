## CREATING A REGION

Regions are the first thing you need to make to protect your builds. RedProtect has a wand similar to WorldEdit's wand, to get it just do `/rp wand`once you have the wand you create a invisible box by left clicking the block in the bottom and right clicking the block in the top. Here you do `/rp define (name)`

## ADDING FLAGS TO YOUR REGION

Flags are used to properly protect your region, they can disallow things or allow certain things such as pvp or building. All flags can be found [here](https://github.com/FabioZumbi12/RedProtect/wiki/Region-Flags) Luckily RedProtect comes with a special GUI to make it easier to edit flags, all you have to do is go into the region you want to change and type in `/rp flag` here you can just select the flags you want to change.

## EXTRA
