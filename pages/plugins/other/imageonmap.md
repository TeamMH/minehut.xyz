# ImageOnMap

## OVERVIEW

Have you ever wanted to view an image on an ingame map? ImageOnMap provides just that. ImageOnMap allows you to load a picture from the Internet to a Minecraft map.

## PLUGIN

### ToMap Command

Firstly, make sure you have a free inventory slot, as the plugin will give you a map. The main command we will be using is **/tomap** . You can resize the maps by adding the width and height after the keyword resize, for example **/tomap url resize 2 4**. You can also change the scaling method by replacing the resize keyword to **resize-stretched** to stretch the image to the surface _\(the image may be distorted\)_, or **resize-covered** to to ensure the image covers the whole surface _\(the image will never be distorted, but some parts may be lost near the borders\)_. The permission node for this is **imageonmap.new**.

### Maps Command:

**/map**s is another command which opens a GUI to see, retrieve and manage user's maps. You can retrieve any created maps, or manage created maps. Maps can be renamed \(for organization\), deleted \(but they won't render in-game anymore!\), or partially retrieved \(for posters maps containing more than one map\). Permission: **imageonmap.list**, **imageonmap.get**, **imageonmap.rename** and **imageonmap.delete** for actions into the GUI.
