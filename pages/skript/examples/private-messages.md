# Example: Private Messages

## OVERVIEW

This tutorial will go over how to set up a private messaging system on your server using Skript, it assumes basic knowledge of Skript \(read posts above if needed\).

## HOW TO SET UP PRIVATE MESSAGING

You can create a messaging system using the [Message effect](https://skripthub.net/docs/?id=1130) in a custom command, here is a basic example:

```vb
command whisper <player> <text>:
  trigger:
      send "%player% whispers to you: %arg-text%" to arg-player
      send "You whispered to %arg-player%: %arg-text%" to player
```

There are 3 components to this command: `<player>`: The player to send a message to. `<text>`: The text to send to said player. The send lines: Sends the message to the requested player, and notifies the player that the message went through.

You are able to add aliases to the command by adding `aliases: /alias-1, /alias-2` to the command, right before the trigger. Note that you cannot have `/msg` or `/tell` as an alias because it is occupied by Minehut's own messaging system.

You can add a usage message to the command by adding `usage: usage message` before the trigger. Example: `usage: &c/whisper (player) (message)`.
