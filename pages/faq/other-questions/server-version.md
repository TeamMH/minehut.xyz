# Server Version

## 1.16

You can customize the Version your server runs on in the **Settings** tab. Minehut has to add versions to this list, and **Custom Jars Are NOT SUPPORTED**

## ALLOWING OLDER CLIENTS TO JOIN

There are currently two different methods of allowing older clients to join. Read below.

### Method One

Install the plugin `ProtocolSupport`, and this will allow clients 1.8-1.16 to join.

### Method Two

Install the plugins `ViaVersion`, `ViaBackwards` and `ViaRewind`. These three combined will allow 1.8-1.16 clients to join.

## 1.8 COMBAT

Most PvP servers will want the original combat system, this is how.

To allow 1.8 combat _\(no hit delay\)_, install the plugin `OldCombatMechanics`.
