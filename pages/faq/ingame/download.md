# Downloading

## Downloading a World

Join your server, find your specific world using `/worlds`, then do `/dl world <world name>`. This may take a second but will create a download link to [https://dl.minehut.com/](https://dl.minehut.com/).

### ALTERNATIVELY

The command `/dl` doesn't always work. You may need to use a World Downloader Mod, such as [this](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/2520465-world-downloader-mod-create-backups-of-your-builds).

## Downloading a Schematic

You can also download a build schematic, which allows you to select a specific build and save it.

### Downloading it

Do `/dl schem <name>`. You can find the list of schematics using `/schem list`.

<Hint style="warning">
