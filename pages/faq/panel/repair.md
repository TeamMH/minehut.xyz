# Repairing Files

## Overview

If you have a problem with your Minehut server, one of the first things we recommend you do is a **file repair**. By repairing your server's files, you're fixing potentially corrupted or missing files that are preventing your server from starting.

<Hint severity="warning">Repairing files will not always work. If that's the case for you, we recommend getting support on the <a href="https://discord.gg/minehut">Minehut Discord</a> with your server's <a href="/faq/panel/logs">logs</a>.</Hint>

## How to repair your server's files

Repairing your server's files is easy. The first thing you'll want to do is go to your Minehut server panel. Once you're there, you should see a menu like this at the top of the page:

You'll want to click the button that says `Danger Zone` on that menu, which should show you something like this:

Finally, click the `Repair Files` button on the card on the bottom left:

<Hint severity="warning">Make sure your server is not in a <strong>starting/stopping state</strong>, as that could make the repair not work!</Hint>

And that's it! You should have your server repair its files for you, all with the push of a button (or a few, if you count that we needed to navigate here)!
