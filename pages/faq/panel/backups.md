# Backups

## OVERVIEW

Want to understand Minehut's backup system? Let go and explore it!

## HOW TO GET TO BACKUPS

To manage your backups, go to your [panel](https://minehut.com/panel/minecraft) (make sure you are signed in) and make sure that the server you want to manage backups on is online. When the server is online, navigate to the "Backups" section at the top of the page.

## SERVER DATA

From here, there are two actions you can perform. You can save the server, though keep in mind Minehut saves hourly, and you can also restore to the latest save.

## SAVED BACKUPS

Each server has at least one backup slot, possibly more if the server has a plan.

You can save a backup by pressing the button labeled "Backup Now", which will occupy a slot and last indefinitely unless deleted or overwritten. You can overwrite the backup by pressing the button labeled "Replace Backup", you can delete with the button labeled "Delete Backup", and lastly you can restore a backup with the button labeled "Restore Server".

You may also provide a name and description for a backup for more information when you need the backup later.
