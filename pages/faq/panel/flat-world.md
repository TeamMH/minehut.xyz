# Creating a Flat World

## HOW TO MAKE YOUR WORLD FLAT

First, go to your server panel, linked [here](https://minehut.com/dashboard).

Once your server is online, go onto your server's dashboard, you can do this by clicking `edit server`.

All you have to do is go to the settings tab and then change the level type to flat, once you've done this you can go ahead to the world tab and click reset world, after that all you have to do is click the restart button and your server's world should be flat! Note that this may delete the current world. If you want to use a plugin to do this, visit [our multiverse tutorial](https://github.com/TeamMH/minehutxyz/tree/3335a0549e4fc3241ab6af734329278af73b6679/faq/panel/plugins/popular/multiverse/README.md). Multiverse is an easy, all in one world management solution.
