## HOW TO RESET PLAYER DATA

### WITH ESSENTIALS

1. Go to your **File Manager** and go to `plugins -> Essentials -> Userdata`.
2. Find the player's UUID. _\(This can be found by looking up their username on_ [_NameMC_](https://namemc.com/)_\)_
3. Delete the file named the player's UUID.

### WITHOUT ESSENTIALS

1. Go to your **File Manager**, and go to your default world. _\(If you havn't uploaded one, it'll most likely be named `world`\)_
2. Then look for a file named `playerdata`, and enter it.
3. Find the specific player's UUID. _\(This can be found by looking up their username on_ [_NameMC_](https://namemc.com/)_\)_
4. Delete the file named the player's UUID.
