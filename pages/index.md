## Every question ever, answered.

**We know Minehut**. We've integrated out knowledge into a **Popular Questions** section, which directed towards questions that are frequently asked. For example ["How do I allow 1.8 clients to join?"](/faq/other-questions/server-version), and ["How do I give my players a permission"](/faq/ingame/permissions). [\[Submit a post\]](/contribute)

## Our plugin know-how

Our team consists of avid server creators, meaning we know all about the plugins players use most. Our helpful **Plugin Tutorials** section gives users top-notch and informative knowledge on the most used and best plugins out there. [\[Submit a post\]](/contribute)

## Developers


Minehut's Skripting community has continued to grow throughout the years, so we've adapted our website to help the developers as much as we can. We've teamed up with some of the best Skript developers out there to write the best tutorials and examples we can. [\[Submit a post\]](/contribute)

## About us

Minehut.xyz was founded on _**August 4th, 2020**_ by two members of the Minehut Community, **Tarna** _\(Former Helper & Senior Support @ Minehut\)_ & **Minehut** _\(Adam, Former Senior Support @ Minehut\)_.

We realised there was no dedicated place for Minehut tutorials where the community can easily upload their own tutorials, so we made one!

Minehut.xyz is not in any way or form affiliated to Minehut. The Minehut logo is a property of Minehut and we do not own it.
